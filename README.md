# Programmer's Learners Program :)
## About
I created this project as a way to teach my boyfriend some fundamentals of coding, right now it is very very basic, but hopefully will expand out into other categories. Feel free to clone the repo and create a branch for items you want to complete (if you want to push something or even contribute something otherwise don't worry about creating a new branch)

As of 7/10/21 I am creating everything in VSCode, but you can use your interpreter/IDE of choice for everything. If you need to install any packages or anything specific to a project, it will be in the file for that project.

## Basic DevOps stuff
For right now, if you want to push stuff it would solely be to learn GitHub's feature set, including PR, branches, etc. If you want to contribute something to the main repo, then it has to be titled `feat/{PROJ_NAME}`

## Tech (As of 7/10/21)
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/) - v3.9.5
